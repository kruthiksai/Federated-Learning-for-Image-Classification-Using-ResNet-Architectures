# Federated Learning Image Classification

This project implements Federated Learning algorithms (e.g., FedAvg, FedSGD, FedDyn, SCAFFOLD) to perform image classification using ResNet models (ResNet-18 and ResNet-50). It supports multiple datasets and customizable training configurations, including IID and non-IID data distributions.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Supports **Federated Learning** algorithms: `FedAvg`, `FedSGD`, `FedDyn`, `SCAFFOLD`
- Trains on multiple datasets: `FMNIST`, `CIFAR`, and `CUSTOM`
- Two deep learning models: `ResNet-18` and `ResNet-50`
- Visualization of accuracy and loss across rounds
- Confusion matrix and classification report
- Inference on test images
