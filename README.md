# Federated-Learning-for-Image-Classification-Using-ResNet-Architectures
This repository explores Federated Learning (FL) using FedAvg, FedDyn, and SCAFFOLD with ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 on CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, and Lung X-Ray datasets under IID and Non-IID settings, analyzing accuracy, loss, and scalability for image classification.
